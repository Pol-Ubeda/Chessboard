# Chessboard
This is a simple cheesboard game in java I created using Swing, a well known Java graphics library.

There are 2 packages, one with the code for every type of piece as a subclass of the `Piece` class, and the other package is filled with the game loop, JFrame setup and Chessboard board draw function, as well as the `Mouse`class.
